name: import
description: Import local files (PDF, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, images, video, scripts) from a staging inbox folder or explicit path into structured markdown notes in 04-resources/. Invoke when user runs /import, /import [path], or /import --attach.
---

# Import

Process local files into permanent vault notes in `04-resources/`.

Usage:
- `/import` — scan default inbox (`00-inbox/imports/`)
- `/import /path/to/file` — import a single explicit file
- `/import --attach` — scan inbox and copy supported files into vault for inline Obsidian preview
- `/import /path/to/file --attach` — single file with attach

---

## Orchestrator Flow

### Step 1: Resolve source and parse flags

Parse arguments:
- Extract `--attach` flag if present (remove from path consideration)
- If a file path is provided after `/import`: this is single-file mode
- If no path: this is batch mode (scan inbox)

**Single-file mode:**
1. Validate the file exists. If not, report and stop.
2. Determine file type from extension (see Supported File Types below).
3. If unsupported type, report:
   > `[filename]` is not a supported file type. Supported: PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, images, video, Python/Shell/SQL scripts.
   Then stop.
4. Note whether the file is inside the inbox folder (used in cleanup — files outside inbox are never deleted).
5. Skip Steps 2 and 3 below. Go directly to Step 4 with this single file.

**Batch mode:**
1. Read `vault.yml` for `folders.import_inbox` (default: `00-inbox/imports`).
2. List all files recursively in the inbox folder.
3. If inbox is empty, report:
   > Inbox is empty (`[inbox path]`). Add files there and run `/import` again, or run `/import /path/to/file`.
   Then stop.

### Step 2: Group and display (batch mode only)

Group files by type. Show a confirmation table:

```
Found N files to import:

  report.pdf          PDF document
  budget.xlsx         Excel spreadsheet
  hero-image.png      Image
  cleanup.sh          Shell script
  deck.pptx           PowerPoint
  unknown.xyz         ⚠ Unsupported — will be skipped

Proceed with all? Or type filenames to skip (comma-separated, or "all"):
```

Unsupported file types are listed with a warning but not processed.

### Step 3: User confirms (batch mode only)

Wait for user response:
- If "all" or blank/enter: proceed with all supported files
- If comma-separated filenames: exclude those files from processing
- Proceed with confirmed set

### Step 4: Dispatch parallel subagents

For each file in the confirmed set, dispatch one subagent in parallel. Each subagent receives:
- Absolute file path
- Detected file type
- Vault root path
- Whether `--attach` flag is set
- Whether the file is inside the inbox folder (cleanup flag)

Each subagent runs the appropriate handler section from this skill (see below).

### Step 5: Collect results and report

After all subagents complete, show a summary:

```
Import complete — 4 notes created:

  04-resources/research/report.md         (from report.pdf)
  04-resources/finance/budget-summary.md  (from budget.xlsx)
  04-resources/media/hero-image.md        (from hero-image.png)
  04-resources/scripts/cleanup.md         (from cleanup.sh)

4 files removed from inbox.
```

If any subagent failed:
```
⚠ 1 file failed:
  deck.pptx — pandoc not installed. File left in inbox. Install with: brew install pandoc
```

If a note was created but the inbox delete failed (partial success):
```
⚠ 1 partial success:
  report.pdf — note created at 04-resources/research/report.md, but inbox file could not be deleted. Delete manually.
```

## PDF Handler

Executed by a subagent. Inputs: file path, vault root, `--attach` flag, inbox flag.

1. Read the PDF file using the Read tool. Claude can read PDFs natively up to 20 pages per request. For large PDFs, read in page ranges.

2. Extract:
   - **Title**: from the document title or first heading, or derive from filename
   - **Author**: if present in metadata or document
   - **Key sections**: major headings and their main points
   - **Core thesis or purpose**: what is this document fundamentally about?

3. Choose output subfolder:
   - Glob existing subfolders in `04-resources/*/`
   - Pick a kebab-case subfolder matching the document's topic (e.g. `research`, `finance`, `legal`)
   - Prefer an existing subfolder if the topic matches; create a new one only if none fit
   - File name: title-cased derivation of the document title (or filename if no title)

4. Create note at `04-resources/[subfolder]/[Title].md` using the Note Template below.
   - `file_type`: `pdf`
   - Summary: 2-3 sentence distillation of the document's purpose and key findings
   - Key Points: bullet list of 3-7 main points from the document

5. If `--attach` flag is set:
   - Read `vault.yml` for `folders.attachments` (default: `attachments`)
   - Copy the PDF into `[attachments]/[filename]`
   - Add `![[filename]]` embed to the note body (above the Summary section)

6. Cleanup:
   - If the file was inside the inbox folder: delete it with the Bash tool (`rm "[filepath]"`)
   - If the file was an explicit path outside the inbox: do NOT delete it
   - If delete fails: report as partial success (note created, manual delete needed)

7. Return: note path, or error with reason
