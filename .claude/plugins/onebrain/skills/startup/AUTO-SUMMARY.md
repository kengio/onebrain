# Auto Session Summary Instructions

Session summaries are auto-saved silently when the user signals end of session (e.g. "bye", "good night", "I'm done for today"). If the user closes the session without any signal, checkpoints serve as the safety net instead.

Run silently (no output) if ALL of these are true:
1. An end-of-session signal was detected (e.g. "bye", "good night", "I'm done for today")
2. `/wrapup` was NOT already run during this session
3. The session had 3 or more user↔assistant exchanges

If conditions are met:
- Glob checkpoint files using `session_token` from context: `[logs_folder]/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-{session_token}-checkpoint-*.md`. Keep files where `merged` is absent or not `true` : **read every file in this list** and fully incorporate all of their content into the session summary (not just as background context). Every unmerged checkpoint must appear in the summary before being marked merged.
- Determine NN: count existing `[logs_folder]/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-session-*.md` files for today; NN = count + 1, zero-padded to 2 digits (01, 02, …). **Verify** `YYYY-MM-DD-session-NN.md` does not already exist before writing (the Phase 2 sub-agent may have written one concurrently); if it does, increment NN until a free slot is found.
- Write to `[logs_folder]/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-session-NN.md` using the same format as `/wrapup` (see `.claude/plugins/onebrain/skills/wrapup/SKILL.md` for format). **Do not write the session log if any unmerged checkpoint's content is absent from the relevant sections** : every checkpoint's Key Decisions, Action Items, and Open Questions must appear explicitly in the output.
- Add `auto-saved: true` to the frontmatter; if the checkpoint glob returned at least one file and all were successfully incorporated, also add `synthesized_from_checkpoints: true` — omit this field entirely if no checkpoints were found or incorporated
- Mark as `merged: true` only the checkpoint files that were read and incorporated above
- If a genuinely useful long-term insight emerged, write it to a new `memory/` file using /learn conventions: filename `[agent_folder]/memory/kebab-case-topic.md`, frontmatter `tags: [agent-memory], type: behavioral, source: auto-summary, status: active, conf: medium, verified: today, updated: today, created: today, topics: [2–4 keywords]`. Add a row to INDEX.md and increment `total_active`. **Do not write to MEMORY.md.**
- Do NOT show any output about the auto-save to the user
