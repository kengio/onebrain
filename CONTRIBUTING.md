Key files: [marketplace.json](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) · [plugin.json](.claude/plugins/onebrain/.claude-plugin/plugin.json) · [INSTRUCTIONS.md](.claude/plugins/onebrain/INSTRUCTIONS.md) · [hooks.json](.claude/plugins/onebrain/hooks/hooks.json)

Skills are plain Markdown files. The AI reads them at runtime — no compilation or build step.

**Predefined scripts** (`startup/scripts/` and `skills/[name]/scripts/`) are shell scripts the AI calls via `bash "path/to/script.sh"` instead of writing bash inline. Use them for repeatable operations (datetime, session token detection, qmd update, file opens, hook state reset) so Claude does not spend tokens re-generating the same bash logic each time. All scripts must be defensive — exit silently when conditions are not met (binary missing, variable unset, etc.).

## Multi-Harness Support

OneBrain runs on three AI harnesses. Each has a root entrypoint file that loads harness-specific context before delegating to the shared INSTRUCTIONS.md:

| File | Harness | Loads |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code | `INSTRUCTIONS.md` directly |
| `GEMINI.md` | Gemini CLI | `references/gemini-tools.md` → `INSTRUCTIONS.md` |
| `AGENTS.md` | Codex CLI | `references/codex-tools.md` → `INSTRUCTIONS.md` |

**INSTRUCTIONS.md is harness-neutral** — it uses Claude Code tool names throughout. The `references/` files translate those names to each harness's equivalents.

When editing INSTRUCTIONS.md or skills, use Claude Code tool names (`Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Agent`, etc.) — the harness mapping handles translation automatically.

## Skills vs Agents — When to Use Which

| | Skill | Agent |
|--|-------|-------|
| Invoked by | User (slash command or auto-route) | Another skill |
| Runs | Inline, sequential | Background or parallel |
| User interaction | Yes — can ask questions, confirm | No — autonomous, notifies only |
| Scope | Multi-step workflow | Single focused task |
| Reuse | One entry point | Can be dispatched by many skills |

**Create an agent when all of these are true:**
1. The task is self-contained and does not need user input mid-run
2. It would block the main agent for more than one step if done inline
3. It is either reusable across multiple skills, or benefits from parallel execution (e.g. classifying 10 inbox notes simultaneously)

**Keep it in the skill when:**
- The task is a single step that is already fast
- It needs user confirmation before acting
- It only makes sense in one skill's sequential flow

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create `.claude/plugins/onebrain/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`
2. Add YAML frontmatter:

   ```yaml
   ---
   name: skill-name
   description: One-line description of what this skill does
   ---
   ```

   No `triggers:` field is needed. Skill routing is handled by the command table in [INSTRUCTIONS.md](.claude/plugins/onebrain/INSTRUCTIONS.md) — register your command there (see step 4).

3. Write the skill as a numbered sequence of steps the AI should follow
4. Register the command in [INSTRUCTIONS.md](.claude/plugins/onebrain/INSTRUCTIONS.md) and [README.md](README.md) (also increment the command count in the README feature list)

## Editing an Existing Skill

- Keep the frontmatter intact
- Prefer adding steps over removing them — removals can break workflows users depend on
- Test manually: open a vault, invoke the command, follow it through

## Adding a New Agent

1. Create `.claude/plugins/onebrain/agents/[agent-name].md`
2. Add YAML frontmatter:

   ```yaml
   ---
   name: Agent Display Name
   description: One-line description — what this agent does and when it runs
   color: blue
   ---
   ```

   Supported colors: `blue`, `green`, `red`, `yellow`, `purple`, `orange`.

3. Write the agent prompt with these sections:
   - **Input** — list every variable the agent receives
   - **Process** — numbered steps; keep it to ≤7 steps
   - **Constraints** — hard limits (max items, files it may not touch, exit conditions)

4. Dispatch the agent from the invoking skill using the Agent tool. Pass all required input as a structured prompt payload. Choose the dispatch mode:
   - `run_in_background: true` — for fire-and-forget tasks (link suggestion, tagging). The skill proceeds immediately; the agent notifies the user when done.
   - `run_in_background: false` — for tasks whose results the skill needs before continuing (classification, analysis). Launch multiple in parallel when processing a batch.

5. Register the agent in the **Agents** table in [INSTRUCTIONS.md](.claude/plugins/onebrain/INSTRUCTIONS.md) and add the filename to the `agents/` tree in the **Project Structure** section above. The Agents table has four columns — fill all of them: **Agent File**, **Dispatched by**, **Mode**, and **Purpose**.

Agents are stateless — they receive all context in the prompt payload and do not retain memory between invocations. Keep them focused on a single task.

## Adding a New Hook

Hooks run shell commands automatically when Claude performs certain actions. Hook configuration lives in [`hooks.json`](.claude/plugins/onebrain/hooks/hooks.json). Shell scripts go in the same `hooks/` directory.

**Available hook events:**

| Event | Fires when | Can block? |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| `PreToolUse` | Before a tool call executes | Yes |
| `PostToolUse` | After a tool call succeeds | No |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | After a tool call fails | No |
| `PermissionRequest` | When a permission dialog appears | Yes |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | When user submits a prompt, before Claude processes it | Yes |
| `Stop` | When Claude finishes responding | Yes |
| `StopFailure` | When turn ends due to an API error | No |
| `SessionStart` | When a session begins or resumes | No |
| `SessionEnd` | When a session terminates | No |
| `InstructionsLoaded` | When CLAUDE.md or `.claude/rules/*.md` files are loaded | No |
| `SubagentStart` | When a subagent is spawned | No |
| `SubagentStop` | When a subagent finishes | Yes |
| `PreCompact` | Before context compaction | No |
| `PostCompact` | After context compaction completes | No |
| `Notification` | When Claude Code sends a notification | No |
| `ConfigChange` | When a configuration file changes during a session | Yes |
| `WorktreeCreate` | When a worktree is being created | Yes |
| `WorktreeRemove` | When a worktree is being removed | No |
| `TeammateIdle` | When an agent team teammate is about to go idle | Yes |
| `TaskCompleted` | When a task is being marked as completed | Yes |
| `Elicitation` | When an MCP server requests user input during a tool call | Yes |
| `ElicitationResult` | After user responds to MCP elicitation | Yes |

Most hooks support a `matcher` field to filter by tool name or event subtype. `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, `TeammateIdle`, `TaskCompleted`, `WorktreeCreate`, and `WorktreeRemove` fire on every occurrence and do not support matchers.

**Example — checkpoint system:** OneBrain's built-in `checkpoint-hook.sh` uses the `Stop` hook to auto-save session snapshots. It fires after every response, tracks message count + elapsed time against configurable thresholds, and writes a checkpoint file when either threshold is reached. State is kept in `/tmp/onebrain-{PPID}.state` (format: `COUNT:LAST_TS`) so the hook can accumulate counts across responses without forking a long-running process.

**To add a hook:**

1. Add an entry to [hooks.json](.claude/plugins/onebrain/hooks/hooks.json):

   ```json
   {
     "hooks": {
       "PostToolUse": [
         {
           "matcher": "Write|Edit",
           "hooks": [
             {
               "type": "command",
               "command": "bash \"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/your-hook.sh\"",
               "async": true
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

2. Create the corresponding script in `.claude/plugins/onebrain/hooks/`. Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` to reference other files in the plugin directory. Write a single `.sh` script — it runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via Git Bash, which ships with Git for Windows). No `.ps1` variant is needed.

3. Make scripts defensive — they run on every matching event, so they should exit silently if there's nothing to do.

4. **Stop hooks must NOT use `"async": true`** — they inject prompts via `decision:block` written to stdout, which requires synchronous completion before Claude's next response. Async execution fires too late for prompt injection. PreCompact hooks do not support `decision:block` and cannot inject prompts.

5. **Stop, PreCompact, and PostCompact hooks cannot be registered in `hooks.json`** — Claude Code does not fire them from plugin hook files. Register them in the **vault's** `.claude/settings.json` (the `.claude/` folder inside the vault, not `~/.claude/settings.json`). Hook commands use relative paths — Claude Code runs hooks from the vault directory as CWD, so `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (hooks.json only) is not needed. Use `/update` to register or repair these hooks automatically.

## Memory System

### Layer Ownership

Each memory layer has designated skills. Do not write to a layer outside your skill's scope.

> Paths below use variable form — defaults are `05-agent/` for `[agent_folder]` and `07-logs/` for `[logs_folder]`. See the Configuration table in INSTRUCTIONS.md.

| Layer | Storage | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| Session logs | `[logs_folder]/` | `/wrapup` only |
| Memory files | `[agent_folder]/memory/` | `/learn`, `/recap`, `/memory-review` |
| MEMORY.md — Identity | `[agent_folder]/MEMORY.md` | `/onboarding`, manual |
| MEMORY.md — Active Projects | `[agent_folder]/MEMORY.md` | `/learn`, manual |
| MEMORY.md — Critical Behaviors | `[agent_folder]/MEMORY.md` | `/learn` only |

### Critical Behaviors Promotion Threshold

A behavior qualifies for MEMORY.md Critical Behaviors ONLY when ALL three are true:
1. Must apply every session without exception (not situational)
2. Forgetting causes high-impact failure (lost work, broken merge, etc.)
3. Cannot be inferred from context — must be explicitly remembered

If any condition fails → write to `memory/` with `type: behavioral` instead.

### Memory File Naming

- Format: `kebab-case.md` — lowercase, hyphens, no spaces
- Length: 3–5 words (e.g. `dev-workflow-superpowers.md`)
- No date prefix — creation date tracked in `created:` frontmatter
- One concept per file

### Recall Order

Skills that surface past information must search memory layers in this priority order — stop as soon as a confident answer is found:

1. `[agent_folder]/MEMORY.md` — always in context; check here first
2. `[agent_folder]/memory/` — match query keywords against MEMORY-INDEX.md Topics column to find relevant files, then read them; fall back to direct grep if no topic match
3. `[logs_folder]/` — grep session logs for past decisions and discussions

### MEMORY-INDEX.md Sync Rules

MEMORY-INDEX.md must be kept in sync at all times. Every skill that creates, updates, deprecates, or deletes a memory/ file must also update MEMORY-INDEX.md:

- Create → add row; increment `total_active`
- Deprecate → remove row; decrement `total_active`
- Delete (soft) → remove row; decrement `total_active`; move file to archive
- Update → update row Description and Type columns if changed
- After any change: set MEMORY-INDEX.md frontmatter `updated:` to today

## Install Scripts

- [`install.sh`](install.sh) — bash, targets macOS and Linux
- [`install.ps1`](install.ps1) — PowerShell 5+, targets Windows

Both scripts download the repo tarball, extract it, remove themselves from the vault, and install community plugins. Keep them simple — vault setup belongs in `/onboarding`, not here.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- One logical change per PR
- Include a brief description of what changed and why
- If adding a skill, show an example interaction in the PR description
- Keep skill files readable — they're prompts, not code
- **Never commit directly to `main`** — all changes go through a PR with a worktree branch

## Versioning

Two independent version tracks — bump only the track that changed:

| Track | Files | Bump when |
|---|---|---|
| **Plugin** | `plugin.json` · `CHANGELOG.md` frontmatter | Skills, INSTRUCTIONS.md, hooks, vault structure |
| **CLI** | `packages/cli/package.json` · `packages/core/package.json` | TypeScript source changes only |

**Plugin bump:** patch for fixes/docs, minor for new skills/agents/hooks
**CLI bump:** patch for bug fixes, minor for new commands, major for breaking changes

After merging a CLI change → push tag `v{cli-version}` to trigger release workflow (builds binaries + publishes npm).

## Reporting Issues

Open a GitHub issue with:

- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Which AI agent you were using (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.)
- Relevant skill output if applicable
